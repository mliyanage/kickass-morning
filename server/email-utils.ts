Thanks so much for signing up for Kickass Morning ‚Äî this means a lot to me.

Waking up early has been something I've struggled with pretty much my whole life. Alarms never worked. Even when I got enough sleep, I'd just shut them off and roll back over.

But whenever I had someone call me ‚Äî like a friend needing a ride to the airport, or an early appointment ‚Äî I'd wake up immediately, no hesitation.

That's what gave me the idea:
What if I could recreate that feeling of someone counting on me ‚Äî using AI?

So I built this little tool, first just for myself. And now you're one of the very first people to try it out.

It's still early days, and I'd really love your feedback.
Please use it for a few days and let me know how it goes ‚Äî good or bad, I want to hear it.
You can just reply to this email or write to me at gangoda@kickassmorning.com.

Here are a few quick tips to get the most out of it:

‚òÄÔ∏è Save the number you get the call from
Make it something motivating like "Drill Sergeant" or "Coach You Got This"

üîï Don't keep your phone on silent
And try to actually answer when it rings ‚Äî that's the whole magic

‚è±Ô∏è Don't go too hard too fast
Set your first call just 30 minutes earlier than your usual wake-up. After a week, you can push it earlier.

I'm also working on a few things behind the scenes:

Letting you connect landline or second numbers

Adding weekly "success report cards"

More voices and even motivational texts

Wake-up calls for other goals, not just mornings

If this helps you even a little, would you mind sharing it on your social media?
That would seriously help me keep building and improving it.

You can link to kickassmorning.com ‚Äî and I'll be super grateful üôè

Thanks again. You've officially got someone to call you out of bed.
Let's crush the morning together.

‚Äì Gangoda
Founder, Kickass Morning`;
